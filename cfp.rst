Nowadays, comfortable toilets are very popular in Japan. For example, 
warmed toilet seats, shower toilets, auto flush, and auto music. However,
they are all proprietary software and hardware. So, there're very limited
customize options. Moreover, we don't want to expose our privacy to
the company. Especially, a toilet should be a highly secured place for us :)
Like those comfortable toilets are controlled by IR. So, it shouldn't be
so hard to control by open-source software and hardware.
In this talk, attendees will get to know the automated toilet system which
controls the temperature of its seat and water, volume and type of water shower
for individuals of my family, and also, what are challenges, benefits, and
disadvantages.
